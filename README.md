# Roll a ball

Roll a ball is the introductory project, meant to familiarize one with basic game design principles and mechanics. From the beginning, the project was rather lacking in scale and ambition. This being said, the basis of the project is split. Rolling a ball, you have a relatively good amount of control over has always proved fun for people. Even in an unfinished state, with only a play area to test mechanics, the gameplay was fun and engaging. 

This being said, the fun grew exponentially once features were added, such as obstacles and a bounce mechanic, allowing for the ball to feel more natural. This bounce also allowed the ball to feel like it has been made from different materials. With an extra springy bounce, the ball without any visual changes, already felt like rubber. Same goes for more rigid bounces, giving the impression of a metal ball ricocheting form a steel plate.

Another addition that enhanced the feeling was the creation of an on-screen display, of both the score and the win message. This system is a given for players and allows the game proper to communicate necessary information. For example, falling into the void or your ball exploding would feel rather confusing if you did not have a visual sign showing you that the game is over as intended.

As for the levels, this game would lend itself to replicability. As such the idea of creating a procedurally generated tile set, in order to essentially create an endless variety of levels is a tempting one. But due to the time constraints and explanatory nature of the project this option is but a mere dream.

As a conclusion, this project is a great general introduction to the game design world, allowing for a basic introduction as well as leaving room for plenty of improvements and personalizationâ€™s to be had.
